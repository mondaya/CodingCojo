                <p>
                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                    JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.
                    It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.
                    JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server),
                    it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <span><a href="#main_content">Variable Declaration</a></span> 
                            JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values -
                            imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.
                            All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
                            These unique names are called identifiers.<span class="js_code">var x:</span>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <span><a href="#main_content">Variable Assignment</a></span> 
                            Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="js_code">var x = 10;</span>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <span><a href="#main_content">Data Types</a></span> 
                            Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.
                            There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives:
                            Boolean - <span class="js_code">true</span> or <span class="js_code">false</span>; null - <span class="js_code">null</span> aka nothing; Number - 
                            <span class="js_code">42</span> or <span class="js_code">3.14159</span>;
                            String - <span class="js_code">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="js_code">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span>
                            and Object - <span class="js_code">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <span><a href="#main_content">Conditionals</a></span> 
                            When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions
                            - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met.
                            You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this.
                            There are the following conditional statements;
                            <span class="js_code">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block;
                            <span class="js_code">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false;
                            <span class="js_code">else</span> we execute this block of code.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <span><a href="#main_content">Loops</a></span> 
                            There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language,
                            but they all essentially do the same thing; they will repeat an action some number of times.
                            Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.
                            That's a loop!
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <span><a href="#main_content">Functions</a></span> 
                            Functions are an encapsulation of a code block.
                            When we call our function this will run that code block.
                            Think of it as a list of instructions.
                            As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea,
                            we open up the instruction manual and get started,
                            first we screw the legs to the table top;
                            next we place the table the right way up. Done!
                            We finished our instructions.
                            Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so let's call our function over and over and over again.
                        </p>
